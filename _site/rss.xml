				<div><p>I‚Äôm not much of a tradition or holiday person in general, but I <em>do</em> like to start the new year by setting out goals for myself.</p>

<p>2024 is the year of the dragon (<em>Finally my sign againüêâ</em>). Feels like an especially important one to make a fresh start.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h3>

<p>Way, way back in grade 1, the teacher had a few different activities that the kids were supposed to do each week. I don‚Äôt remember most of the activities because I only ever did one. The activity was filling out a specific notebook that the teacher provided. The notebook pages were divided into two sections: the top two-thirds of the page were blank and the bottom third had ruled lines to write on. They were usually cut into fun shapes, which just added to the fun.</p>

<p>I pretty quickly monopolized those notebooks, to the point where it was addressed in some kind of parent teacher interview situation, with the teacher begging me to do something else, anything else. (<em>I didn‚Äôt</em>).</p>

<h3 id="i-wouldnt-exactly-call-myself-an-illustrator">I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call myself an illustrator</h3>

<p>The past few years most of my output has been digital illustration, but the illustrator box I‚Äôve been stuck in has felt increasingly suffocating. I‚Äôve always loved drawing, but it‚Äôs never been my only love. Not even my first.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> has always been my true love. The more I‚Äôve neglected to nurture the storyteller in me, the more uninspired and frustrated I‚Äôve felt overall.</p>

<h3 id="creative-focus-for-2024">Creative focus for 2024</h3>

<p>So! This year I‚Äôm going to nurture the storyteller.</p>

<p>My main creative focuses this year are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prose</strong>: I‚Äôve done <a href="/stories/patron-saints">a bit</a> of <a href="/stories/standalone/">writing</a> this past year but need to work those creative writing muscles more consistently. (<em>I do a lot of writing at my dayjob but technical writing is a pretty different beast</em>). I have a backlog of first drafts, WIPs, and outlines that I just need to sit down and dedicate time to.</li>
  <li><strong>Game development</strong>: I started learning <a href="https://godotengine.org/"><strong>Godot</strong></a> on the recommendation of a friend who is an actual proper developer. I love Twine and interactive fiction, but I also want to dive into making more game-y games.</li>
  <li><strong>Sculpting and modeling</strong>: I got back into <a href="https://www.blender.org/"><strong>Blender</strong></a> again and am having a lot of fun with it. 3D modelling really helped me realize how much I‚Äôve missed sculpting with my hands, so I‚Äôve been getting back into that as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs the overall roadmap for now. I‚Äôll keep drawing, but I‚Äôm sticking to drawing as <strong>part</strong> of what I do, not the whole that defines me.</p>

			<title>New Year, first post</title>

    		<p>2 min.</p>
				<div><p>At the end of the year last year, I decided to take a step to regroup and figure out how to navigate my relationship with art and online spaces. I didn‚Äôt expect that reflection time to take all of 2023 and then some, but then life kept Happening.</p>

<p>I felt very much like Humpty Dumpty teetering atop a swiss cheese-ass lookin‚Äô Jenga tower while some unseen malevolent force pulled out piece after piece until it all toppled down. (<em>Yes that metaphor is a mess, but so was life.</em>) The silver lining was that lying broken on the floor doesn‚Äôt give you much else to do <em>except</em> reflect. And I‚Äôm feeling optimistic about where I‚Äôve landed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="creating-content">‚ÄúCreating Content‚Äù</h5>

<p>I‚Äôve already <a href="https://wickedliltongue.tumblr.com/post/704357808625401857/art-versus-artist-2022-i-dont-usually-do-these">ranted</a> about how bad online spaces have been over the past couple of years, so I won‚Äôt spend too much time going over it all again. Suffice to say, it‚Äôs been hard to find any joy in making art and sharing it knowing that it‚Äôs just going to become fuel for the horrors of the Content Machine.</p>

<p>My desire to make art doesn‚Äôt come from a desire to make money; money is a necessary evil to survive. My boyfriend likes to poke fun at me for being ‚Äúallergic to making money off my art‚Äù. But he‚Äôs not entirely wrong. The moment that making money becomes the primary motivation to make art is the moment I lose all interest. Making art is like breathing. It‚Äôs necessary. It‚Äôs a core part of who I am. And how can I possibly tie that down to a price tag? What‚Äôs the monetary value of each inhale and exhale?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="my-brand-is-being-chaotic">My ‚Äúbrand‚Äù is being chaotic</h5>

<p>I‚Äôve always struggled with trying to build my work around a specific niche or artistic discipline. I may barely sleep for a week doing a deep dive into say, making a <a href="/games/interactive-fiction">little interactive game</a>, then not touch Twine for another 3 years because I‚Äôve picked up 10 other crafts, only to decide that making games is pretty fun, and maybe I should do some more of that. Committing to a single discipline, subject, or even technique just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Especially not on a timeline, which has always made having a consistent online presence tricky. (Hello ADHD, sure was eye opening learning <em>that</em> about myself).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So I‚Äôm not going to! I‚Äôm just going to commit to following my interests, at my own pace, and seeing where it leads me.</p>
