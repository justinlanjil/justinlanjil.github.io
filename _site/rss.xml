			<title>Sculpting rough maquettes</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>3 min.</p>
				<div><p>I really wanted to make a Frank Frazetta style sculpture of a couple of my characters Yra and Urd. I‚Äôm aiming for 1:7 scale and did the armatures but ran into a couple of snags trying to work from my sketch.</p>

<p>The first issue is that when doing mock up sketches, I always find it hard to work out how the composition will look from different angles (<em>part of the fun of having <a href="https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/">aphantasia</a></em>).</p>

<p>The second but related issue was the base. I didn‚Äôt want to use pure clay for the base (<em>I only have a couple of lbs of Monster Clay</em>) but needed a better sense of what shape the base actually needed to be to fit the figures, especially since I need to be able to pierce into it with wire.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be easier to give myself a reference to work from and whip up a couple of 1:11 scale maquettes.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-bodies">Making the bodies</h3>

<p>I started by printing my turnaround ref at the right scale (<em>Urd‚Äôs 1:11 is much bigger than Yra‚Äôs</em>), and built simple armatures with 16 gague aluminium wire. Then I added a rough rib and pelvis shape with apoxy and a thin coating around the arms, legs, and shoulders to limit the articulation.</p>

<p>After the apoxy dried (<em>24 hours is a long wait</em>), I used some Super Sculpey to built up the shapes a bit. I ended up making a bit of a mistake around the legs by not accounting for them having to bend, so after I baked them I carved out the grooves needed to get the legs to bend enough.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-faces-by-working-smarter-not-harder">Making the faces by working smarter not harder</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm still working out how to sculpt faces in that kind of flat style, and doing it at 1:11 scale was kind of not worth it for a quick mockup.</p>

<p>So, since I had some (<em>accidentally</em>) knock-off <a href="https://myfigurecollection.net/?_tb=item&amp;title=Body-kun">Body-kun and Body-chan</a> figures that I never really used because of the limited articulation. I tore them apart and made some quick face molds with Easy Mold.</p>

<p>I baked the initial mold then added the ears and flattened the nose bridge, baked them again, then added the head and stuck it on the wire. I had to add some apoxy afterwards because they didn‚Äôt want to stick.</p>

<p class="caption">The adapted Body-chan face mold.</p>

<h3 id="sword">Sword</h3>

<p>For the sword, we had some flat wooden sticks lying around that would work pretty well for the sword shape I needed. I tried cutting out the handle but it ended up snapping since the wood was so thin, so instead I filed a groove out and used armature wire and apoxy to form a rudimentary handle and pommel.</p>

<h3 id="the-results">The results</h3>

<p>Pretty happy with how they turned out, though I definitely learned some lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first and biggest one is that aluminum wire is no good for something that needs to bend over and over again. Which I should have known but alas.</li>
  <li>They each had a leg snap at the knee when I was re-carving. If I do a second set, I‚Äôll use steel wire instead.</li>
  <li>The sculpey and apoxy also cracked a lot around where it met the wire, and didn‚Äôt adhere very well to the wire.</li>
  <li>The scale of the heads is too big, I‚Äôll need to actually make a custom sculpt in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">They live! I didn‚Äôt spend too much time making them pretty but they‚Äôll do the trick.</p>

<h3 id="putting-the-maquettes-to-use">Putting the maquettes to use</h3>

<p>Honestly I was able to match my rough sketches pretty closely which is exciting! I took some pictures to sketch on top of for some of the additional details and where I wanted to make adjustments. I just used plasticine for the base to get a sense of the shape and scale, which was <em>very</em> different than what I was picturing.</p>

				<div><p>I‚Äôm not much of a tradition or holiday person in general, but I <em>do</em> like to start the new year by setting out goals for myself.</p>

<p>2024 is the year of the dragon (<em>Finally my sign againüêâ</em>). Feels like an especially important one to make a fresh start.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h3>

<p>Way, way back in grade 1, the teacher had a few different activities that the kids were supposed to do each week. I don‚Äôt remember most of the activities because I only ever did one. The activity was filling out a specific notebook that the teacher provided. The notebook pages were divided into two sections: the top two-thirds of the page were blank and the bottom third had ruled lines to write on. They were usually cut into fun shapes, which just added to the fun.</p>

<p>I pretty quickly monopolized those notebooks, to the point where it was addressed in some kind of parent teacher interview situation, with the teacher begging me to do something else, anything else. (<em>I didn‚Äôt</em>).</p>

<h3 id="i-wouldnt-exactly-call-myself-an-illustrator">I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call myself an illustrator</h3>

<p>The past few years most of my output has been digital illustration, but the illustrator box I‚Äôve been stuck in has felt increasingly suffocating. I‚Äôve always loved drawing, but it‚Äôs never been my only love. Not even my first.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> has always been my true love. The more I‚Äôve neglected to nurture the storyteller in me, the more uninspired and frustrated I‚Äôve felt overall.</p>

<h3 id="creative-focus-for-2024">Creative focus for 2024</h3>

<p>So! This year I‚Äôm going to nurture the storyteller.</p>

<p>My main creative focuses this year are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prose</strong>: I‚Äôve done <a href="/stories/patron-saints">a bit</a> of <a href="/stories/standalone/">writing</a> this past year but need to work those creative writing muscles more consistently. (<em>I do a lot of writing at my dayjob but technical writing is a pretty different beast</em>). I have a backlog of first drafts, WIPs, and outlines that I just need to sit down and dedicate time to.</li>
  <li><strong>Game development</strong>: I started learning <a href="https://godotengine.org/"><strong>Godot</strong></a> on the recommendation of a friend who is an actual proper developer. I love Twine and interactive fiction, but I also want to dive into making more game-y games.</li>
  <li><strong>Sculpting and modeling</strong>: I got back into <a href="https://www.blender.org/"><strong>Blender</strong></a> again and am having a lot of fun with it. 3D modelling really helped me realize how much I‚Äôve missed sculpting with my hands, so I‚Äôve been getting back into that as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs the overall roadmap for now. I‚Äôll keep drawing, but I‚Äôm sticking to drawing as <strong>part</strong> of what I do, not the whole that defines me.</p>

			<title>New Year, first post</title>

				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>2 min.</p>
				<div><p>At the end of the year last year, I decided to take a step to regroup and figure out how to navigate my relationship with art and online spaces. I didn‚Äôt expect that reflection time to take all of 2023 and then some, but then life kept Happening.</p>

<p>I felt very much like Humpty Dumpty teetering atop a swiss cheese-ass lookin‚Äô Jenga tower while some unseen malevolent force pulled out piece after piece until it all toppled down. (<em>Yes that metaphor is a mess, but so was life.</em>) The silver lining was that lying broken on the floor doesn‚Äôt give you much else to do <em>except</em> reflect. And I‚Äôm feeling optimistic about where I‚Äôve landed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="creating-content">‚ÄúCreating Content‚Äù</h5>

<p>I‚Äôve already <a href="https://wickedliltongue.tumblr.com/post/704357808625401857/art-versus-artist-2022-i-dont-usually-do-these">ranted</a> about how bad online spaces have been over the past couple of years, so I won‚Äôt spend too much time going over it all again. Suffice to say, it‚Äôs been hard to find any joy in making art and sharing it knowing that it‚Äôs just going to become fuel for the horrors of the Content Machine.</p>

<p>My desire to make art doesn‚Äôt come from a desire to make money; money is a necessary evil to survive. My boyfriend likes to poke fun at me for being ‚Äúallergic to making money off my art‚Äù. But he‚Äôs not entirely wrong. The moment that making money becomes the primary motivation to make art is the moment I lose all interest. Making art is like breathing. It‚Äôs necessary. It‚Äôs a core part of who I am. And how can I possibly tie that down to a price tag? What‚Äôs the monetary value of each inhale and exhale?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="my-brand-is-being-chaotic">My ‚Äúbrand‚Äù is being chaotic</h5>

<p>I‚Äôve always struggled with trying to build my work around a specific niche or artistic discipline. I may barely sleep for a week doing a deep dive into say, making a <a href="/games/interactive-fiction">little interactive game</a>, then not touch Twine for another 3 years because I‚Äôve picked up 10 other crafts, only to decide that making games is pretty fun, and maybe I should do some more of that. Committing to a single discipline, subject, or even technique just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Especially not on a timeline, which has always made having a consistent online presence tricky. (Hello ADHD, sure was eye opening learning <em>that</em> about myself).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So I‚Äôm not going to! I‚Äôm just going to commit to following my interests, at my own pace, and seeing where it leads me.</p>
