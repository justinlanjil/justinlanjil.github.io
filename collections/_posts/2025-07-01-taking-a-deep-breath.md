Well, hello, here I am. I didn’t really mean to be gone for so long. Like other creatives, I’ve been reckoning with the pervasive and insidious creep of generative AI in creative spaces.

I have a full time job; I didn’t need to be making art to survive. I thought the best way that I could help my fellow creatives working professionally was to not feed the beast. So about two years ago. I pulled down all of my art, purge my accounts, and since then I’ve kept my creative work offline. 

I didn’t stop, because trying to stop making art would be like trying to stop breathing.

But I’ve been surviving so far by numbing myself to it as much as I can. Keeping my head down, doing my work, which I do extremely well, in the same way that I have been. Trying to ignore it when I can, let it wash over me when I can’t. Just trying not to engage. Still, I can’t get through a meeting or a conversation without it involving genAI. Recently they made it a mandate to use AI, and if you don’t, then you don’t have a job.

It’s been soul-crushing, to put it lightly. I’ve lost count of the number of tears shed, panic attacks, dark moods, futile rages, and wasted listless time over the past couple of years because of this.

It’s been especially bizarre to be working professionally as a technical writer, a job that I genuinely enjoy, in a deeply toxic environment; a tech company that gleefully embraces all of the worst stereotypes of exploitative tech bros. I could almost hear the higher ups licking their lips ready to replace my job with AI. Much to their disappointment, writers have proven to be irreplaceable, so here I still am, years later.

Recently, I took a few days off to stave off the burnout that had climbed to a fever pitch. It was only a few days, and not the only bit of time off that I’ve taken in the past couple of years. But something was different this time.

I got to spend a few days just living in the world around me, sitting in the sun, breathing in fresh air. Not having to hear about the monster that’s been chipping away at my soul. And I read. Specifically I re-read, and fell in love with all over again, some of my favourite stories. Work that’s genuinely touched me. I felt like I could breathe for the first time in years. And only then did I realize how much I’ve been suffocating.

I hadn’t really understood that by isolating myself and hiding away, and being barraged day-to-day by a world that’s gleefully embracing the exploitation of artists, I’ve completely lost the other side of things. Lost community, and compatriots, and deprived myself of the essential joy of getting to experience the work of other artists.

Needless to say it was completely intolerable going back to work, and has been ever since. I’m terrified of letting it drag me down into that numbness again. I’m not very good with metaphors, but to lean on another one, it feels like I’ve come in from the cold. And the sensation returning is so fierce that it’s painful. 

It’s been more than just a little sobering to open up old projects and seeing “Last Modified: November 2023”. That feels like an awfully long time to not have Hard not to dwell on the regret of all of that lost time.

I’m somewhat of a hermit at my core, but I want to do better. And show up, and be present. I want to make games, and write stories, and sculpt, and draw for myself, and to celebrate the stories I love. And I want to do that where I can share in that essential and core joy with others.
