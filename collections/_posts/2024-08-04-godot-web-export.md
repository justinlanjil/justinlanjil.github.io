I downloaded [Godot 4.3 Release Candidate 2](https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-3-rc-2/) to see if Web Export is fixed and...it is! Going to import my [20 games challenge games](/games/20-games-challenge) into 4.3, fix them up, and add them to their respective pages. Flappy Bat is up, Pong needs a bit of work from design bugginess.

I'm mostly motivated to post it because of Breakout tbh. I might end up being a little half-assed with a few of the upcoming challenges and not upload them, but we'll see how it goes. I also might spice up the gameplay pages as well to add some custom styling...depending on how much work I want to put in.
