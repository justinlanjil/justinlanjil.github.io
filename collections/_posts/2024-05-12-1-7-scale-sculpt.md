With my [1:11 scale maquette set up and posed](20240402_sculpting-rough-maquettes/), I started work on the 1:7 scale versions.

The first step was to create the 1:7 scale armatures, then make a foam base to save clay, and then start sculpting.

Monster clay is just so nice to work with, and using it gives me the freedom and flexibility to edit as much as I want. The only downside is that it can't be cured. So, my overall plan is to build out a mostly detailed model with Monster clay, and then I'll create a mold, cast it, and chop it up into pieces to refine further. 

### 1:7 scale armatures

I decided to make and print 3d models of the head, ribcage, and pelvis in Blender to add to the armature. Since I'm using Monster clay, I don't have to worry about the armature being oven safe, so I printed them on my [SV06](https://www.sovol3d.com/products/sovol-sv06-best-budget-3d-printer-for-beginner) with PLA. In the end, I didn't bother printing the heads since I'll use a different construction method.

The biggest pain was getting the wire to stick to the PLA. I tried super glue, then switched to apoxie which did work better, but not perfectly.

I was trying to figure out a simple way to get the wire for the clavicle in the right place. The loop in front solution I did for this version wasn't great. The loop broke, and the loop placement meant I had to scale down the rib too much, which kind of defeated the point of having it as a landmark.

For V2 I'll probably just chop off the top of the ribcage so that it ends where the clavicles connect to the sternum.

### Cutting the foam base 

Since I didn't have any proper crafting foam, I opted for using some scrap leftover from a package. This foam is really squishy and did not want to stick together, but it was better than nothing. Using the foam cutter is incredibly satisfying.

Went a bit ham with the foam cutter. I collected up the scraps in a bad for future use.

The armature stuck in pretty easily.

Next time I try this method, I'll spend more time figuring out the scale, and maybe keep the shapes simpler and more blocky. There's clay going on top to form the terrain and details anyway.

### Starting to build

Monster clay comes in an oven safe container, which is so cool, but my oven's lowest heat setting is too hot for the clay. After a couple of weeks of heating the clay up with the oven door open to keep it cool enough, I just went and bought a little crockpot to keep it in. Saves me having to work in the kitchen and create a fire hazard.

I started by slapping on some of the basic forms for the arms, legs, torso and some of the basic musculature. I broke off a lot of this initial sculpting as I made adjustments to the poses.

Slapped some Monster clay on to get started.

I covered the foam base in dollar store plasticine to keep it distinct from the figures and also to save the Monster clay. The structural integrity of the base is not great, but it's good enough for this stage. I did a couple of quick heads with some face landmarks to help with the poses.

The next part will be the most time intensive: refining the sculpt. It's incredibly satisfying to work on though, I'm having a ton of fun.
