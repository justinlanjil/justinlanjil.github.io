I really wanted to make a Frank Frazetta style sculpture of a couple of my characters Yra and Urd. I'm aiming for 1:7 scale and did the armatures but ran into a couple of snags trying to work from my sketch. 

The first issue is that when doing mock up sketches, I always find it hard to work out how the composition will look from different angles (*part of the fun of having [aphantasia](https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/)*). 

The second but related issue was the base. I didn't want to use pure clay for the base (*I only have a couple of lbs of Monster Clay*) but needed a better sense of what shape the base actually needed to be to fit the figures, especially since I need to be able to pierce into it with wire.

So I thought it would be easier to give myself a reference to work from and whip up a couple of 1:11 scale maquettes.

### Making the bodies

I started by printing my turnaround ref at the right scale (*Urd's 1:11 is much bigger than Yra's*), and built simple armatures with 16 gague aluminium wire. Then I added a rough rib and pelvis shape with apoxy and a thin coating around the arms, legs, and shoulders to limit the articulation. 

After the apoxy dried (*24 hours is a long wait*), I used some Super Sculpey to built up the shapes a bit. I ended up making a bit of a mistake around the legs by not accounting for them having to bend, so after I baked them I carved out the grooves needed to get the legs to bend enough.

### Making the faces by working smarter not harder

I'm still working out how to sculpt faces in that kind of flat style, and doing it at 1:11 scale was kind of not worth it for a quick mockup.

So, since I had some (*accidentally*) knock-off [Body-kun and Body-chan](https://myfigurecollection.net/?_tb=item&title=Body-kun) figures that I never really used because of the limited articulation. I tore them apart and made some quick face molds with Easy Mold. 

I baked the initial mold then added the ears and flattened the nose bridge, baked them again, then added the head and stuck it on the wire. I had to add some apoxy afterwards because they didn't want to stick.

### Sword

For the sword, we had some flat wooden sticks lying around that would work pretty well for the sword shape I needed. I tried cutting out the handle but it ended up snapping since the wood was so thin, so instead I filed a groove out and used armature wire and apoxy to form a rudimentary handle and pommel.

### The results

Pretty happy with how they turned out, though I definitely learned some lessons:

- The first and biggest one is that aluminum wire is no good for something that needs to bend over and over again. Which I should have known but alas. 
- They each had a leg snap at the knee when I was re-carving. If I do a second set, I'll use steel wire instead.
- The sculpey and apoxy also cracked a lot around where it met the wire, and didn't adhere very well to the wire.
- The scale of the heads is too big, I'll need to actually make a custom sculpt in the future.

They live! I didn't spend too much time making them pretty but they'll do the trick.

### Putting the maquettes to use

Honestly I was able to match my rough sketches pretty closely which is exciting! I took some pictures to sketch on top of for some of the additional details and where I wanted to make adjustments. I just used plasticine for the base to get a sense of the shape and scale, which was *very* different than what I was picturing.

Now onto the next step, building it all again in 1:7 scale.
