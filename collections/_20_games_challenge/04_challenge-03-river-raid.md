## Challenge outline checklist

[Challenge outline](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/river_raid) at the **20 Games Challenge site**.

### [Goals](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/river_raid/#goal)

- [x] Create and animate a jet fighter. The screen will scroll vertically, and the jet can move side to side. The player can accelerate or brake, which will change the vertical scrolling speed.
- [ ] Add a river bank on both sides of the level. The river can vary in size, or even split into two streams. Hitting the river bank will kill the player.
- [ ] Divide the game into levels. Between levels, the river will narrow, and there will be a bridge crossing it. Bridges act as checkpoints. The player must shoot the bridge, colliding with it will kill the player.
- [ ] Add some enemies! Boats and helicopters will move back and forth across the river. Jets will cross the entire screen. Colliding with an enemy will kill the player.
- [ ] Add fuel depots. Flying over these will replenish the player‚Äôs fuel reserves. The player can shoot and destroy fuel depots, but colliding with them doesn‚Äôt kill the player.
- [ ] Add a UI with a life counter, score, and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge will drain slowly, and the player will die if it reaches ‚Äúempty‚Äù
- [x] Give the player the ability to shoot things! Shooting things increases the player score.

## [Stretch Goals](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/river_raid/#stretch-goal)

- [ ] Not sure how to make the game infinitely long? The easy way would be to create multiple hand-crafted levels that start and end with a bridge. The fun way would be to generate the levels dynamically on the fly.
- [ ] The Atari 2600 could only display limited sprites. Modern computers are capable of creating massive particle effect explosions. You know what to do üòâ

## Notes

I'm going to just start this one with basic placeholder blocks in order to get the mechanics down before I commit to any real asset building.

## Retrospective

I almost skipped this one but then I decided it would be funny to do a [Cask of Amontillado](https://poemuseum.org/the-cask-of-amontillado/) theme, with a reveal at the end. I'm glad I did
