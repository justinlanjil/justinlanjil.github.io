## Challenge outline checklist

[Challenge outline](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/flappy/#goals) at the **20 Games Challenge site**.

### [Goals](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/flappy/#goals)

- [x] Create a game world with a floor.
- [x] Add an object that represents the main character. Apply a constant force to the character so it falls to the floor.
- [x] Add obstacles on the left of the game area. The obstacles should slide across the screen toward the right. The obstacles will appear in pairs, with a vertical gap between them.
- [x] Detect when the character collides with the floor or obstacles, and reset the game when a collision occurs.
- [x] Accumulate one point for each obstacle that the player passes. Display the score.

## [Stretch Goals](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/flappy/#stretch-goals)

- [x] Add some sounds that will play each time the player gains a point, and when the player loses.
- [x] Add a basic game-over screen to display the playerâ€™s score.
- [x] Add a menu and allow the player to reset the game.
- [x] Track the high-score between play sessions and display the high score alongside the current score.
- [x] Add some background art! Try layering the background and scrolling at a different rate to the foreground obstacles. This is called Parallax scrolling.

## Notes

- I imported over some of the code from Pong, for example the scoring, and modified it a bit as needed
- I thought that the high score and persistent score save would be a challenge but it took maybe 10 minutes.
- Once again ran into an issue of using `Area2D` nodes for the elements instead of `CharacterBody2D`, which meant figuring out collision manually.
- The player movement is also a little janky without the advantage of a `CharacterBody2D`. Even though I spent a lot of time tweaking the movement, the implementation was pretty simple.
- The only real puzzle with this one was how to track the point score. I opted for adding an `Area2D` with a `CollisionShape2D` just after the right edge of the pillar with a `Signal` to detect when the player successfully got to the other side of the pillar.
- I'd previously looked at parallax backgrounds so I knew what to do here.

## Retrospective

I went with Pong as the first challenge because of familiarity. I knew about Flappy Bird but I'd never played it. When I found a version online to play around with, I then discovered that I'm really, really bad at it.

Nevertheless, I wonder how it would have gone if I'd started with Flappy Bird instead of [Pong](games/20-games-challenge/01-challenge-01-pong). This was a much, much simpler game to start with, even with the stretch goals. The bulk of the time I spent in development was just making the assets for it. The actual game came together incredibly quickly.

I thought I'd have a little fun and make it a bat instead of a bird, and have the pillars be stalactites and stalagmites to make the aesthetic a bit more coherent than the original game.
