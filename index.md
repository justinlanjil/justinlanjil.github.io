##### I’m Justin, <span style="text-transform: lowercase; font-weight: 500;">a queer artist and storyteller with a fascination for the spooky, fantastical, romantic, and macabre.</span>

I fancy myself something of a renaissance man, in the sense that I have a lot of creative passion paired with a short attention span.

This site is a space for me to collect and chronicle my various creative works. Expect to find a hodgepodge of subjects, including:
- visual art
- prose
- sculpting
- textile work
- game development 

…along with any other artistic pursuit that captures the attention of my magpie brain.
