I’m Justin, a queer artist and storyteller with a fascination for the spooky, fantastical, romantic, and macabre.  

I fancy myself something of a renaissance man, in the sense that I have a lot of creative passion paired with a short attention span.  

This site is a space for me to collect and chronicle my various creative works. Expect to find a hodgepodge of subjects, including (in no particular order of importance or frequency):  
- visual art
- prose
- sculpting
- textile work
- game development 

…along with any other artistic pursuit that captures the attention of my magpie brain.  

I’ll be documenting works in progress, resources I’ve found, and things I’ve learned along the way.
