I'm not much of a tradition or holiday person in general, but I *do* like to start the new year by setting out goals for myself.

2024 is the year of the dragon (*Finally my sign againüêâ*). Feels like an especially important one to make a fresh start. 

### A bit of backstory

Way, way back in grade 1, the teacher had a few different activities that the kids were supposed to do each week. I don't remember most of the activities because I only ever did one. The activity was filling out a specific notebook that the teacher provided. The notebook pages were divided into two sections: the top two-thirds of the page were blank and the bottom third had ruled lines to write on. They were usually cut into fun shapes, which just added to the fun. 

I pretty quickly monopolized those notebooks, to the point where it was addressed in some kind of parent teacher interview situation, with the teacher begging me to do something else, anything else. (*I didn't*).

### I wouldn't exactly call myself an illustrator

The past few years most of my output has been digital illustration, but the illustrator box I've been stuck in has felt increasingly suffocating. I've always loved drawing, but it's never been my only love. Not even my first.

**Storytelling** has always been my true love. The more I've neglected to nurture the storyteller in me, the more uninspired and frustrated I've felt overall.

### Creative focus for 2024

So! This year I'm going to nurture the storyteller. 

My main creative focuses this year are:

- **Prose**: I've done [a bit](/stories/patron-saints) of [writing](/stories/standalone/) this past year but need to work those creative writing muscles more consistently. (_I do a lot of writing at my dayjob but technical writing is a pretty different beast_). I have a backlog of first drafts, WIPs, and outlines that I just need to sit down and dedicate time to.
- **Game development**: I started learning [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) on the recommendation of a friend who is an actual proper developer. I love Twine and interactive fiction, but I also want to dive into making more game-y games.
- **Sculpting and modeling**: I got back into [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/) again and am having a lot of fun with it. 3D modelling really helped me realize how much I've missed sculpting with my hands, so I've been getting back into that as well.

That's the overall roadmap for now. I'll keep drawing, but I'm sticking to drawing as **part** of what I do, not the whole that defines me.
