I'm not much of a tradition or holiday person in general, but I *do* like to start the new year by setting out goals for myself. And this year feels like an especially important one to make a fresh start. 2024 is the year of the dragon (my sign), and the impending end of a long time in the 12th house passing at last into the 1st.

The past few years most of my output has been digitial illustration, but the illustrator box I've been stuck in has felt increasingly suffocating. I've always loved drawing, but it's never been my only love. Not even my first. 

Way, way back when I started in Grade 1, the teacher had a few different activities that the kids could do. I don't remember most of the activities because I only ever did one. The teacher had these little notebooks in fun shapes. The top two-thirds were blank paper and the bottom third had a few lines to write on. I pretty quickly monopolized those notebooks, to the point where it was addressed in some kind of parent teacher interview situation, with the teacher begging me to do something else, anything else. (I didn't).

**Storytelling** has always been my true love. The more I've neglected to nurture the storyteller in me, the worse I've felt overall. 

So! This year I'm going to nurture the storyteller. My main creative focuses are going to be:
- **Prose**: I've done [a bit](/stories/patron-saints) of [writing](/stories/standalone/) this past year but need to work those creative muscles more consistently. I have a lot of works in progress and outlines that I want to dedicate the time to finishing this year.
- **Game development**: I started out learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) on the recommendation of a developer friend because I had some really bad vibes about Unity. (And sure am glad I did). I love Twine and interactive fiction, but I also want to dive into making adventure games.
- **Sculpting and modeling**: I got back into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) again and am having a lot of fun with it. 3D modelling really highlighted how much I missed sculpting with my hands, so I've been getting back into that as well.

<br>

That's the overall roadmap for now. I'll keep drawing, but I'm sticking to drawing as part of what I do, and plan to work as an illustrator for my *own* stories.
