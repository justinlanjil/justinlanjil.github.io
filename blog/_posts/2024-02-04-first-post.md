excerpt: "Starting off the new year (at bit late) with the results of a year of reflection on making and sharing art."

At the end of the year last year, I decided to take a step to regroup and figure out how to navigate my relationship with art and online spaces. I didn't expect that reflection time to take all of 2023 and then some, but then life kept Happening.  

I felt very much like Humpty Dumpty teetering atop a swiss cheese-ass lookin' Jenga tower while some unseen malevolent force pulled out piece after piece until it all toppled down. (*Yes that metaphor is a mess, but so was life.*) The silver lining was that lying broken on the floor doesn't give you much else to do *except* reflect. And I'm feeling optimistic about where I've landed.

##### "Creating Content"

I've already [ranted](https://wickedliltongue.tumblr.com/post/704357808625401857/art-versus-artist-2022-i-dont-usually-do-these) about how bad online spaces have been over the past couple of years, so I won't spend too much time going over it all again. Suffice to say, it's been hard to find any joy in making art and sharing it knowing that it's just going to become fuel for the horrors of the Content Machine.

My desire to make art doesn't come from a desire to make money; money is a necessary evil to survive. My boyfriend likes to poke fun at me for being "allergic to making money off my art". But he's not entirely wrong. The moment that making money becomes the primary motivation to make art is the moment I lose all interest. Making art is like breathing. It's necessary. It's a core part of who I am. And how can I possibly tie that down to a price tag? What's the monetary value of each inhale and exhale?

##### My "brand" is being chaotic

I've always struggled with trying to build my work around a specific niche or artistic discipline. I may barely sleep for a week doing a deep dive into say, making a [little interactive game](/games/interactive-fiction), then not touch Twine for another 3 years because I've picked up 10 other crafts, only to decide that making games is pretty fun, and maybe I should do some more of that. Committing to a single discipline, subject, or even technique just doesn't work for me. Especially not on a timeline, which has always made having a consistent online presence tricky. (Hello ADHD, sure was eye opening learning *that* about myself).

So I'm not going to! I'm just going to commit to following my interests, at my own pace, and seeing where it leads me.
