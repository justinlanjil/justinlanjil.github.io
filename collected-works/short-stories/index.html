Actually this page should be an index page of subfolders (standalone, patron saints, etc) so need a seperate index layout for that.
This works too!!! 

Hmm added the to the config defaults as per the docs but no dice

{% for story in site.stories %}
sdfsds
[{{ story.title }}]({{ story.url }})
{% endfor %}
